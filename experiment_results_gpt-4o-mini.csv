What don't axolotls undergo that other amphibians do?","Axolotls, unlike many other amphibians, do not undergo a process called metamorphosis. While most amphibians, such as frogs and toads, transition from a larval stage (tadpoles) to an adult form (with lungs and the ability to live on land), axolotls retain their larval features throughout their lives. This phenomenon is known as neoteny, where they remain aquatic and gilled, even as they reach sexual maturity."
