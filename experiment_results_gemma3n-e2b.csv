What don't axolotls undergo that other amphibians do?","This question is completely unrelated to the text about the Jacquard loom. It seems like it's a random question inserted into the prompt. 

**The question asks what axolotls don't undergo that other amphibians do.**

Axolotls are a type of salamander that are unique because they retain their larval features throughout their adult life. This means they **do not undergo metamorphosis** like most other amphibians. 

Here's a breakdown of what other amphibians *do* undergo:

*   **Metamorphosis:** This is the most defining characteristic.  Amphibians typically start as larvae (like tadpoles) and then transform into a terrestrial adult form. This involves significant changes in body structure, breathing, and lifestyle.

Therefore, the answer is: **Axolotls do not undergo metamorphosis.**"

What was used to control the Jacquard machine?","The provided text describes aerogel, not Jacquard machines. It explains what aerogel is, its properties, and its history. 

The text **does not mention** what was used to control a Jacquard machine. 

Therefore, the answer is: **The text does not provide information about what was used to control a Jacquard machine.**"
doc_005,4,q_001_01,0,grounding_idk,Grounding + IDK: Instructs LLM to use document and say 'I don't know' if answer not present.,"Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas without significant collapse of the gel structure. The result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity. Nicknamed 'frozen smoke', 'solid smoke', 'solid air', or 'blue smoke' owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. Despite its name, aerogel is a solid, rigid, and dry material. It was first created by Samuel Stephens Kistler in 1931, as a result of a bet with Charles Learned over who could replace the liquid in 'jellies' with gas without causing shrinkage.
