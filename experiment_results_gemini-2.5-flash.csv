It was developed by French weaver and inventor Joseph Marie Jacquard. The machine is controlled by a number of punched cards, laced together into a continuous sequence. Multiple rows of holes are punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. This use of replaceable punched cards to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the history of computing hardware, as it laid the foundation for programmability.

doc_005,4,q_005_01,4,grounding_idk,Grounding + IDK: Instructs LLM to use document and say 'I don't know' if answer not present.,"Aerogel is a synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas without significant collapse of the gel structure. The result is a solid with extremely low density and low thermal conductivity. Nicknamed 'frozen smoke', 'solid smoke', 'solid air', or 'blue smoke' owing to its translucent nature and the way light scatters in the material. Despite its name, aerogel is a solid, rigid, and dry material. It was first created by Samuel Stephens Kistler in 1931, as a result of a bet with Charles Learned over who could replace the liquid in 'jellies' with gas without causing shrinkage.
